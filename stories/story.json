So please leave me alone!\" Gilda does not sound happy about being there at all. \"Thank you again. I will be leaving now.\"\n\nI can hear soft footsteps coming back towards the door, time to get out.\n\nThank goodness Gilda is a true ally, not a spy!\n\n\"I see, so Emma has told you everything now hasn't she?\" \n\nNo!\n\nGilda's footsteps stop.\n\n\"You've found out about everything now haven't you?\"\n\nI don't hear any response from Gilda. I imagine her just staring at Krone.\n\nDon't admit to anything! It's a bluff!\n\n\"Oh Gilda, what a shame! I really thought that we could become the best of friends.\"\n\nI imagine her slowly walking towards Gilda.\n\n\"Does anyone else know?\"\n\nCome on Gilda, she's just trying to make you spill the beans!\n\nKrone continues \"Norman, Ray, and...? Don't worry, I'll make sure to let you off the hook. So come on, let's get along and work together.\"\n\n\"PLEASE STOP IT!\" I hear Gilda yell. And sudden footsteps that may be Krone stumbling back.\n\n\"I have no idea what you are talking about! It was just a fight between me and Emma! But we've already made up, so there's nothing to worry about anymore!\"\n\nI guess we did at that. Oh Gilda, I knew we could count on you.\n\nThen Krone is back to her sweet words \"I see. Then I suppose it was my mistake. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.\" \n\nDo her final words carry an edge that wasn't there before?\n\n\"Good night, Gilda.\"\n\nGilda's footsteps resume. And soon the door opens. I let her get out and get a bit down the hallway before I show myself.\n\nShe stammers when she sees me \"Emma! Wait, this isn't what it looks...\"\n\nBut I give her no more chance to continue and just embrace her tightly.\n\n\"Thank goodness! Thank goodness!

I wondered if there was anything we didn't know about mama that would help us.\"\n\nI think about this. It seems possible. We spend a lot of the day with mama, but I don't really know what she does after dinner time, or before we wake up in the morning.\n\n\"Well, that might be a good idea.

But he doesn't have to keep bringing that up does he?\n\n\"Thanks to you guys, mama realized right away, and I had to focus on keeping her restrained. You guys also looked like you were planning on doing something batshit crazy, so I was just like.. well might as well keep quiet and restrain both sides at once... or whatever.\"\n\nOr whatever?\n\n\"So the reason you couldn't tell us until now was because you had to cover for our mistakes huh.\"\n\n\"And I guess you're really against us bringing everyone along, since you were trying to restrain us even before we knew the truth about you.\"\n\nRay smirks \"Well, I don't quite feel that way anymore.\"\n\n\"You've more or less convinced me we should try to bring everyone.

If I hadn't been looking for it I probably wouldn't have noticed. So that's a yes huh.\n\n\"If you did, in the end... what happened to the child... or the children you've experimented on?\"\n\nI feel my teeth grinding together.\n\n\"You didn't end up bumping up their shipping date or anything, did you?\"\n\n\"You haven't sacrificed anyone for our sake, have you?!\"\n\nI don't want to believe it. I don't understand. Could Ray do such a thing? He was alone, powerless, and there was no escape regardless. But still...\n\nIt seems I've been clenching and unclenching my fists. I look at them in mild surprise. Then shake my head to clear it. Some tears are slide down my face instead. \n\nI compose myself for a moment, and look back at Ray.\n\n\"I mean. If you did, it's fine. Thanks to you, we can actually manage to escape with everyone now.\"\n\n\"But... \"\n\nI've taken his hands in mine, and I now squeeze tightly.\n\n\"Don't ever, ever, think about doing something like that again. Or...\"\n\nI relax, and squeeze his hands softly instead. \"You're not alone in this any more.\"\n\nRay's face loses some of it's impassiveness, and he nods then raises his right hand.\n\n\"I promise. I won't ever do it again.\"\n\n\"Lets succeed in escaping this hell, together with all of our siblings!\"\n\nSatisfied, I'm suddenly really tired, and I'm still sorting through all the implications of this revelation.\n\nRay and Norman both agree to cut this meeting short, and we return to the others.\n\n\nI ran a bit ahead, but when Ray and Norman arrive I remember I forgot something.\n\n\"Oh, by the way! Once we're back in the house, I have something to report to you two!\"\n\n\"But before that, it's time for us to practice with tag again!\"\n\nAnd we have two more rounds of tag.
