Writer2
=======

This is the second writer. The first one was very, very basic.

Actually, this is probably the third or fourth writer, but I never bothered making a different repository after version 2.

## Usage

This project is intended to be reading and writing software. It'll have a reading and writing mode.

The backend is currently a mix of plain text files and a postgres database. I'll make it all work with postgres eventually.

There's a heavy AI component to the application mode, and it'll help you by answering questions, and rewriting your shitty prose for you.

## Release

> [!CAUTION] 
> It's not done, unless you are confident in figuring out how to install/run it, wait.
