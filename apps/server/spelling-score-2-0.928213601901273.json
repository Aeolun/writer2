  "fixedSummary": "<p>The bridge device. My last true mission and the first of many suicide missions I have been sent on. Ever since I finished that mission my country has been trying to kill me. Now I suppose they have given up and just discharged me from their military. </p>\n\n<p>Now that I am no longer a soldier all that I have is a job my father like friend has given me and this game. The problem is, why is it that the day this game was released, the scientist who built both the game and the bridge device and the device itself simply dissapear. Esspcially since they were in the most monitered and secure vault in the entire country?</p>",
