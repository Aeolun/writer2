  "fixedSummary": "<p>This is a FF based off of some of the concepts from 'Dawn Traveler' but is ultimately my own world.</p>\n\n<p>David Lee is a hybrid half goblin/human; he himself is unaware of his goblin heritage. David simply belives that he is small for his age and ugly, little dose he know that his village was over run by monsters and on that day he was concived. </p>\n\n<p>Aiden Gray is a human from earth at the age of five his alter-ego David Lee was born into a fantasy world. Knowledge of another world with magic and monsters has left Aiden discontent with modern day earth leading him to become an adrenaline junkie.  </p>\n\n<p>A boy (David Lee) stuck in a world without his favorite sweet (chocolate) decides to make his own but the undertaking is greater than he could have imagined. A man (Aiden Gray) alone in a boring world turns to extremes and looks for anyone to connect with. Specifically looking for others like him who have somehow exchanged normal dreams for a whole new world.</p>",
