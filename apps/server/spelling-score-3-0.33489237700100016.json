An expansive world ruled by a top tier AI capable of accommodating each and every player and their needs!<br/><br/>Here we follow the story of Richard, and his avatar, the golem Gondorrer, as he comes and plays a MMO in one of the most dificult ways for no other reason than a sudden impulse, and fail miserably a few times before finally getting it right.<br/><br/>Follow him in his adventures, composed by epic monster battles, custom made equipments, bad jokes, not right in the head friend, along with an unhealthy addiction to Monster Hunter, lots of rolling and window-balls!<br/>--------------------------------------<br/>Okay, this is my first story here and it will probably be full of errors and such since my native language is portuguese, but any and all (constructive) critics are welcome.</p>",
