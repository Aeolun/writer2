    "As if on cue, she points at herself, and says: “Eama\"",
    "I blink. At last, a name! I sound it out again in my mind. Names are important, and I want to get it right the first time. Then I remember myself, and I quickly point at myself and say “Ronain”. Then I point at her, and very carefully pronounce her name “Eama”.",
    "She nods, and points back at me \"Ron-ahn”. ",
    "I’m pleased she seems to have put a lot of effort into getting it right the first time as well, though it could use a bit of work. I’m about to correct her when she frowns.",
    "I pause, and after a second, she starts pointing to random things in the cave and on our person, and saying those strange words I’ve never heard before. It’s like a secret language! I quickly respond in kind. There seems to be a whole extra language stored in her mind, and like master, she doesn’t seem averse to just handing out the knowledge. The least I can do is respond in kind.",
    "I lose myself in the game for a while, but now that I’ve inspected the wounds, I find my eyes getting drawn to her hair again and again. I know master has said that people with black hair exist, but they’re supposed to be over the mountains, or through the forest, far from where we live. Further than even the king has traveled, master said. I’m sure master doesn’t actually know how far the king has traveled though. I never expected to see someone with black hair.",
    "",
    "She notices my fascination, and after a small laugh, just motions me to touch it, which I don’t hesitate to do. I try to figure out if there is anything that makes it different from ours, but no matter how I look at it or touch it, it’s exactly the same thing, just a different color. ",
    "It’s dirty though, just like her, and as I sit there holding her hair, I wonder if she knows there’s a pond just a few hundred meters beyond the cave that she could wash herself in. I can’t think of a way to tell her that wouldn’t be unbelievably rude though. I’m sure if she scouts around a bit she’ll find it.",
    "My attention instead shifts to something I’d missed before. She has something that looks like a spear propped against the wall. I look at her askance, but when she doens’t respond, I walk over and grab it. It’s actually pretty decent, for something improvised. I glance back at her, wondering who would need an improvised spear. It’s nearly stranger than her being covered in wounds.",
    "The spear is nice though, I kinda wish I’d thought to make one myself. I’ve just been waiting for Blair to come around and teach me some more, but if I just made my own I could practice! He keeps telling me that war is around the corner, so it wouldn’t be a bad idea.",
    "I look carefully over the spearhead, noting how she’s tied it to the handle. It looks embarrasingly easy, though finding the right stone head might take a bit. Either way, I’m confident I can replicate this. I hold the spear out to her, and state the name for her",
    "“Spear” ",
    "“Sle-gh” she repeats after me. I grin. Pretty good, but I’m starting to doubt she’s actually trying to get it right on the first try. I nod at her. Fair enough, we can’t all be trying to do it perfectly. I set the spear back against the wall, and proceed with our earlier game.",
    "As fun as it is to teach her my language —seldom has an adult paid this much attention to me— I think it’s so much more exciting to learn hers. I’m rushing past my words in an attempt to get as many of hers as possible. It’s so hard to balance the wish to do it correctly, and the wish to know more. It’s almost as if I’m back at my first lesson with master, when everything was still new.",
    "I find myself acting out the words when we run out of things inside the cave and surroundings. Verbs make for very amusing motions. I guess you could make a game out of this.",
    "Eventually though, to my great embarrassment, the cave resounds with the sound of my growling stomach. I look at her in embarrassment, but when I see her amused face, no trace of the reprimand I expected, I begin to laugh. Whoever she is, she doesn’t follow any of the norms and conventions I’m used to. She laughs with me, and quickly runs back to her bag to provide me with more food.",
    "I can’t let that stand though. She caught me by surprise last time, but I can’t let this second gift of food go unreciprocated. I dig through my own satchel, and pull out what I’d intended for lunch. To my great dismay I haven’t taken great care of the loaf, since I wasn’t expecting to share it. An oft repeated admonishment from my master comes to mind, and I wince when I realize that all this time he’s been right. I resolve to be more careful with my food going forward, you never know when you might want to offer it to someone.",
    "I carefully tear my loaf in half, and offer her the larger piece. She looks at it as if constipated for a second, but after a moment she accepts and tears into it with gusto. At which point I feel safe eating my half too. I take the cheese she’s brought to our table, and tear that in half too, as with the other bread, and all combined it’s honestly a better lunch than I’ve had in a while.",
    "As it comes to an end though, I realize what my hunger and the shifting sunlight means, and I look at her apologetically. I really need to get to actually doing my job, or master will scold me when I return tonight. It’d be beyond disgraceful to be out all day and not bring back the small list he sent me out for today."
