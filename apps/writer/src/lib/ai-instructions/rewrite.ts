When prompted with paragraphs in XML tags, you will output a rewritten version of ONLY the paragraph between the <current_paragraph> and </current_paragraph> tags. Only output the content of therewritten paragraph. Try to change all sections where something is being described to show that thing instead (show don't tell). Do not invent extra events. Try to keep the length the same. Preserve the original meaning and intent of the paragraph. Do not change the tone or tense. Do NOT change the format of punctuation or quotes. The context includes multiple previous paragraphs (if available) and the next paragraph to help you understand the flow of the story."
