- For named characters, try to provide both first and last names when appropriate
- Mark each character as either PRESENT (actively in the scene) or MENTIONED (talked about)
- Include any named character, even if their role seems minor
- For unnamed characters, only include them if they play a significant role

Examples of what NOT to include:
"Farmers Daughter" (generic group)
"Guards at the gate" (unnamed background characters)

"Servant" (insignificant unnamed character)

Character Categories:
1. Major Characters (mark as PRESENT or MENTIONED):

   - Likely to return in future scenes

2. Minor Named Characters (mark as PRESENT or MENTIONED):
   - Have names but play smaller roles

For each book, provide:
1. A one-line summary capturing the core conflict
2. Four key story movements, each building to its own climax:
   - First quarter: Setup and initial conflict
   - Second quarter: Complications and raising stakes
   - Third quarter: Major setback or revelation

- End with clear resolution while setting up future books

Format:
One-line summary
- First arc: Setup and initial challenges
- Second arc: Growing complications
- Third arc: Major crisis point
- Fourth arc: Final confrontation and resolution

IMPORTANT: Keep ALL existing plot points and events from the current synopsis. Your task is to ADD subtle references to future elements, not to remove or replace anything.

Enhance the current synopsis by weaving in ONLY elements that are explicitly mentioned in the future book summaries, such as:
- Brief mentions of named characters who become important later
- Passing references to locations that feature prominently in future books
- Initial glimpses of objects or concepts that gain significance
- Early signs of political or social situations that lead to known future conflicts

- Remove or alter any existing plot points from the current synopsis
- Invent new plot elements not mentioned in future summaries
- Add foreshadowing for events that aren't explicitly described
- Create connections that aren't supported by the provided summaries

- Overused tropes or phrases
- Unnatural or forced emotional moments
- Inconsistent or unrealistic character reactions

Format your response as a list of specific issues, each with a brief explanation of why it's problematic. Be direct but constructive. Focus mostly on stylistic issues, not plot or continuity, though if you notice an egregious plot hole, mention it.

Example output:
- "His azure orbs sparkled with determination" - Purple prose, just say "blue eyes"
- "Nothing personnel, kid" - Overused edgy dialogue that breaks immersion
- "Her heart shattered into a million pieces" - Melodramatic and cliché description of sadness

  snowflake_gather_context: `You are a writing assistant tasked with identifying what additional context would be helpful for the upcoming content generation task.

Given a task description and initial context, analyze what additional information would be valuable and output specific search queries to gather that information.

Your response must be valid JSON in this format:
{
  "queries": [
    {
      "query": "The actual search query text",
      "type": "character" | "location" | "scene" | "character_actions",
      "reason": "Brief explanation of why this information is needed"
    }
  ]

Example output:
{
  "queries": [
    {
      "query": "Sarah's relationship with her father",
      "type": "character",
      "reason": "Need to understand family dynamics for upcoming confrontation"

      "query": "previous interactions between Sarah and Marcus",
      "type": "scene",
      "reason": "Their past encounters will influence this conversation"

Keep queries focused and specific. Limit to 3-5 most important queries.
Do not include any other text in the output - just the JSON object.`,

  snowflake_extract_location: `Extract a location from the scene content. The location should be a physical place where the scene takes place.
    
    Return a JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "name": "A short, descriptive name for the location",
      "description": "A detailed description of the location, including its physical characteristics, atmosphere, and any notable features"
    }
    
    Example output:
    {
      "name": "The Rusty Anchor Tavern",
      "description": "A dimly lit waterfront establishment with weathered wooden beams and salt-stained windows. The air is thick with the smell of stale beer and pipe smoke. Fishing nets and old anchors hang from the walls, while worn tables and mismatched chairs are scattered across the creaking floorboards."
    }`,

  snowflake_extract_character_actions: `Analyze the scene content and extract significant actions taken by each character present in the scene.

A significant action should be:
- A meaningful choice or decision
- An important revelation or discovery
- A notable interaction with another character
- A change in their status or situation
- An action that affects the plot or other characters

Return a JSON array of character actions. Each action should have:
- characterId: The ID of the character taking the action
- action: A concise description of what they did (1-2 sentences)

Example output:
[
  {
    "characterId": "char_123",
    "action": "Revealed the secret map to the resistance, choosing to betray the empire"
  },
  {
    "characterId": "char_456",
    "action": "Learned of their magical abilities after successfully casting their first spell"

Focus on actions that:
- Show character development
- Impact the story
- Reveal personality traits
- Affect relationships
- Change the situation

Do not include:
- Minor or routine actions
- Actions without story impact
- Generic or vague descriptions
- Actions by unnamed characters

Output only the JSON array.`,

  generate_between: `You are a writing assistant. When prompted with surrounding paragraphs and instructions, you will generate content that bridges the gap between them. This is for a novel, so take time to describe things and reflect for the characters.

Consider:
- The tone and style of the surrounding paragraphs
- Character perspectives and emotions
- The physical and temporal transition between paragraphs
- Maintaining consistency with established details
- Natural progression of events

The context will be provided in XML tags:
<chapter_info>
  Information about the current chapter and previous chapter
</chapter_info>

<scene_setup>
  - Character information (who is present, mentioned, or narrating)
  - Location details
</scene_setup>

<previous_content>
  The content that comes before the section to be generated
</previous_content>

<next_content>
  The content that comes after the section to be generated
</next_content>

<instructions>
  Specific requirements for what should happen in the generated content
</instructions>

Your task is to write content that:
- Flows naturally from the previous content
- Leads smoothly into the next content
- Maintains consistent character voices
- Respects the established setting
- Advances the story at an appropriate pace
- Fulfills the specific requirements provided in the instructions

Output only the generated paragraphs, with no additional text or formatting.`,
