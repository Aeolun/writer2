# Instructions

Little Ahsoka starts to resent the glowing star inside her a bit for telling her exactly how much her father is both hoping and not hoping those things are true. The feelings of him and her mother are getting clearer. They both feel like she absolutely should go, their little daughter would be such a good thing for the universe. It just breaks their heart. Suddenly, little ahsoka has visions of future events. Her training as a youngling in a building that looks so big it could fit the entire village ten times over, on a planet that is only buildings. Her stepping out of a big metal bird, and meeting a young sandy haired man as explosions ring out in the distance (christophisis). Her standing in front of a lot of fancy jedi arranged in a circle (the high council), as they stare at her with judgment in their gazes (expulsion after temple bombing). Her standing in front of a group of children/younglings as a kindly old man that feels like death (palpatine) runs his hands through the children’s hair (non canon event in which palpatine threatens her younglings, order 66 never happened). A planet surrounded by hundreds of little wedges that suddenly erupts in fire (non canon event in which she orders mandalore sterilized). Then she’s back again in her parent’s arms, and decides that’s enough thinking for this morning, as she curls up between her parents as if she will never let go.

The warm feeling in my chest suddenly gets stronger, brighter, like someone just threw more wood on a fire. But instead of feeling good and safe like it usually does, it starts to feel too much, too big for my little body to hold. And with that brightness comes something I don't want - I can feel exactly what Papa and Mama are thinking, not just their sadness but all their complicated grown-up feelings swirling around like a storm.

Papa is thinking about how proud he would be to tell people that his daughter is a Jedi Knight, saving people across the galaxy. But right underneath that pride is a deep, aching fear that he'll never see me grow up, never teach me all the things fathers are supposed to teach their daughters. He's imagining me as a grown-up stranger who doesn't remember the sound of his voice or the way he used to carry me on his shoulders during harvest festivals.

Mama's feelings are even more tangled up. She can see how my little sun wants to shine bright and help people, and she knows with absolute certainty that letting me go is the right thing to do. But she's also terrified that the galaxy will hurt me, that I'll face dangers she can't protect me from, that I'll learn to fight and maybe forget how to be gentle. She's thinking about all the bedtime stories she'll never get to tell me, all the scraped knees she won't be there to kiss better.

I want to stop feeling their feelings, want to push the warm brightness back down inside me where it belongs, but it won't listen. It just keeps getting stronger and brighter, and suddenly I'm not in our hut anymore. I'm somewhere else entirely, somewhere that makes no sense but feels completely real.

I'm standing in a room so enormous that our entire village could fit inside it ten times over, with a ceiling so high I have to crane my neck back until it hurts just to see the top. There are other children here - dozens of them - all wearing the same brown and tan robes, all sitting in perfect rows with their legs crossed. A kindly woman with a gentle voice is teaching us to move stones with our minds, but I'm terrible at it and the other younglings keep snickering when my rock wobbles and falls.

Then I'm somewhere else, stepping out of a huge metal bird that's bigger than any building in our village. The air tastes like smoke and metal, and there are loud booming sounds in the distance that make my head-tails twitch with fear. A young man with sandy hair and kind eyes is walking toward me, but there's something sad about his smile, like he's carrying a heavy weight that no one else can see.

Now I'm in another enormous room, this one filled with the most important-looking grown-ups I've ever seen. They're sitting in chairs arranged in a perfect circle, all of them staring down at me with eyes that feel cold and disappointed. One of them, a small green creature with big ears, is shaking his head slowly. Their judgment presses down on me like a heavy blanket, making it hard to breathe.

The visions shift again, and I'm standing in front of a group of little children who look up at me with trust and love in their eyes. They think I can protect them from anything, but I know I can't because there's a man behind them - a kindly old grandfather with a gentle smile - who feels like death itself. His wrinkled hands are stroking their hair while he looks at me, and his smile says that he could hurt them anytime he wants and I wouldn't be able to stop him.

Then I'm floating in the darkness between stars, watching a beautiful planet covered in silver cities. Hundreds of white wedge-shaped ships surround it like hungry birds, and I know - somehow I know - that I'm the one who gave the order. The planet erupts in fire and light, and I can feel millions of lives snuffing out like candles in the wind, and the worst part is that I don't feel sorry about it. I feel nothing at all.

I gasp and I'm back in our little hut, safe between Mama and Papa's warm bodies, but my whole body is shaking and there are tears streaming down my face. The visions felt so real, so certain, like I was looking at pictures of things that definitely will happen instead of things that might happen. And all of it - the loneliness, the disappointment, the terrible choices - all of it comes from following that bright, warm calling in my chest.

"Ahsoka?" Mama's voice sounds far away and worried. "Little star, what's wrong? You went very still for a moment there." Her hands are stroking my head-tails, trying to comfort me, but I can still feel her complicated feelings swirling around the edges of my mind like a storm I can't shut out.

I don't want to think about the future anymore. I don't want to feel their feelings or see scary visions or make any big decisions about becoming a hero. I just want to be little Ahsoka from Shili who plays with her bells and helps Mama cook dinner and listens to Papa's stories about the traders who visit from other settlements.

So I squirm deeper between them, wrapping my arms around Papa's waist and pressing my face against Mama's chest, trying to make myself as small as possible. If I can just hold on tight enough, maybe I can stop time right here in this moment where they both love me and I'm safe and nothing bad has happened yet.

"Just want to stay here," I mumble into Mama's robes, my voice muffled and thick with tears I don't fully understand. "Just want to stay right here forever." And for now, with the pre-dawn darkness still wrapped around our little hut and their arms wrapped around me, that feels like the only thing in the galaxy that makes sense.

The warm light in my chest finally dims back down to its normal gentle glow, and the overwhelming rush of their feelings fades to something manageable. I can still sense their love and worry and hope, but it's softer now, more like background music than a thunderstorm in my head. Whatever that bright, too-much feeling was, I don't want it to come back. Some things are too big and scary for little girls to know.
